## ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why is plugin not listed?</strong></summary>

  That usually happens in two cases:
  - Repository doesn't have the `neovim-plugin` or `neovim-plugins` tag
  - Those tags were added less than 24h ago, and the crawler hasn't refreshed the database yet

  If neither applies ‚Äî please [create an issue](https://github.com/alex-popov-tech/store.nvim.crawler/issues).

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why is plugin not installable?</strong></summary>

  A plugin is considered installable if it has at least one *valid* configuration block in its readme. If it isn‚Äôt marked as installable, try the following:
  - Wait up to 24h after last readme change ‚Äî the crawler needs time to re-fetch and re-process it.
  - Make sure code blocks contain valid Lua code. You can check this using `lua-ls` ‚Äî just create a `tmp.lua` file and paste the code block into it.
  - Adding clear context before code blocks helps too. For example, prefix it with something like: `lazy.nvim configuration example`.
  - You can also check the latest debug artifacts from the README processor [here](https://github.com/alex-popov-tech/store.nvim.crawler/actions/workflows/crawler.yml).

  If none of that helps, and your plugin should be installable ‚Äî please [create an issue](https://github.com/alex-popov-tech/store.nvim.crawler/issues/new).

<details>
  <summary><strong>I have a <code>lazy.nvim</code> config in readme, but <code>store.nvim</code> suggests using a migrated version from <code>packer</code>/<code>vim-plug</code>.</strong></summary>

  By default, native `lazy.nvim` configs are preferred. If you have one but it's not being used:
  - Wait up to 24h after your last README.md change ‚Äî the crawler may not have picked it up yet.
  - Ensure your `lazy.nvim` config block is valid Lua. `lua-ls` can help with that (try pasting it into a temporary `tmp.lua` file).
